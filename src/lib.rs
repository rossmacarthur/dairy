/// can enclose and provide immutable access to borrowed data, and clone the
/// data lazily when mutation or ownership is required. The type is designed to
/// work with general borrowed data via the `Borrow` trait.
///
/// `Cow` implements `Deref`, which means that you can call
/// non-mutating methods directly on the data it encloses. If mutation
/// is desired, `to_mut` will obtain a mutable reference to an owned
/// value, cloning if necessary.
